# bedrock-multi-instance
A simple .exe to enable and disable multi-instancing for Minecraft Bedrock Edition (allows you to open Minecraft Bedrock in more than 1 window.

# Does this allow me to have multiple MCBE windows open with more than 1 account?
Yes!

Open your game and make sure you're signed in, then switch accounts and open a new mcbe instance, and voilla. This used to not work on older versions, but because Microsoft is stupid (likely answer), its now possible :)
